## What it does ✨
Hackathon Wizard is a hackathon simulator/productivity template for hackers that can help hackers with hackathons in several ways. For example, it can:
- Help them practice their skills and learn new technologies in a fun and interactive way.
- Help them develop their creativity and problem-solving abilities by exposing them to various scenarios and challenges.
- Help them improve their time management and teamwork skills by simulating the hackathon environment and constraints.
- Help them prepare for their presentations and get feedback from judges and mentors.
- Help them gain confidence and motivation by rewarding them for their achievements and progress.
- Help them discover new ideas and opportunities by exploring different themes and technologies.

## How we built it ✅
The design document and early ideation was written in notion. The aim is to build a playable demo project with unreal engine. As a game artist, I am able to create 3d models and visual designs for games, but with this project, I will have to focus on more technical parts of game development to create my solution for the theme: Hacks for Hackers.
- Unreal Engine with Blueprints scripting for game development
- Notion for design documentation and productivity template

## Challenges we ran into 🚀
- publishing an unreal engine game for the first time
- File size limits on Github

## What's next for Hackathon Wizard 🧙🏻‍♂️
- Troubleshooting our prototype interface, optimising file sizes and overall performance
- Publishing the playable prototype for users from MLH, Devpost and broader online community to test and provide feedback.
